    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>NEXT_NODE
The Waypoint has to be linked to the geographically nearest valid node within 
the configured link distance. A node is valid if it can be used by the configured vehicle type.

NEXT_SEGMENT 	
The Waypoint has to be linked to the geographically nearest valid segment within
the configured link distance. A segment is valid if it can be used by the configured 
vehicle type.

NEXT_MAIN_NODE
The Waypoint has to be linked to the geographically nearest valid main node (e.g., 
a motorway interchange )within the configured link distance. A main node is a 
collection of entry-nodes representing the interchange, and it is valid if it can be 
used by the configured vehicle type. A main-node is a collection of entry-nodes
representing the interchange.

FUZZY_LINKING
The Waypoint has to be linked by fuzzy linking according to a given radius. 
NOTE: FUZZY_LINKING is only valid for VIA-Points.

AUTO_LINKING
The Waypoint has to be linked by auto linking according to the following three steps. 
1. Use link-type NEXT_SEGMENT. 
2. If the segment is not a motorway, take the segment. 
Otherwise, we may accidentally have the segment in the wrong direction, since 
motorways have usually seperate lanes. Because of this the segment is rejected 
and in a second step link-type NEXT_MAIN_NODE is used. 
3. If NEXT_MAIN_NODE is used it is checked if one entry node of the main 
node is a toll station. In this case all toll nodes are returned which belong to 
toll station with the minimal distance to the main node.

NEXT_MAIN_TOLL_NODE
This LinkType is not supported anymore, please use a different one.

TOLL_STATION
The Waypoint has to be linked to the geographically nearest valid toll station
within the configured link distance. A toll station is valid if it can be used by
the configured vehicle type.

TI_LINKING
Linking is executed in two steps: 
1. Use link-type NEXT_MAIN_NODE. If some segments adjacent to an entry-nodes 
of the resulting main-node has the wanted name, take all these entry-nodes. 
2. Otherwise, consider all segments within a given radius.

    <value>NEXT_NODE
The Waypoint has to be linked to the geographically nearest valid node within 
the configured link distance. A node is valid if it can be used by the configured vehicle type.

NEXT_SEGMENT 	
The Waypoint has to be linked to the geographically nearest valid segment within
the configured link distance. A segment is valid if it can be used by the configured 
vehicle type.

NEXT_MAIN_NODE
The Waypoint has to be linked to the geographically nearest valid main node (e.g., 
a motorway interchange )within the configured link distance. A main node is a 
collection of entry-nodes representing the interchange, and it is valid if it can be 
used by the configured vehicle type. A main-node is a collection of entry-nodes
representing the interchange.

FUZZY_LINKING
The Waypoint has to be linked by fuzzy linking according to a given radius. 
NOTE: FUZZY_LINKING is only valid for VIA-Points.

AUTO_LINKING
The Waypoint has to be linked by auto linking according to the following three steps. 
1. Use link-type NEXT_SEGMENT. 
2. If the segment is not a motorway, take the segment. 
Otherwise, we may accidentally have the segment in the wrong direction, since 
motorways have usually seperate lanes. Because of this the segment is rejected 
and in a second step link-type NEXT_MAIN_NODE is used. 
3. If NEXT_MAIN_NODE is used it is checked if one entry node of the main 
node is a toll station. In this case all toll nodes are returned which belong to 
toll station with the minimal distance to the main node.

NEXT_MAIN_TOLL_NODE
This LinkType is not supported anymore, please use a different one.

TOLL_STATION
The Waypoint has to be linked to the geographically nearest valid toll station
within the configured link distance. A toll station is valid if it can be used by
the configured vehicle type.

TI_LINKING
Linking is executed in two steps: 
1. Use link-type NEXT_MAIN_NODE. If some segments adjacent to an entry-nodes 
of the resulting main-node has the wanted name, take all these entry-nodes. 
2. Otherwise, consider all segments within a given radius.

&lt;0: Bonus (the minumum value -99 will reduce the cost value to a minimum, i.e. the road segments are preferred)
=0: No change (Default)
&gt;0: Malus (the maximum value 2501 or BAN are interpreted as road segments blocked)</value>

  <data name="gbxAvoid.ToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Represents one routing option. The option type is described by the enumeration RoutingParameter
All RoutingOptions are optional and have default values defined in the default properties definition 
file. Each RoutingOption can be assigned to a certain vehicle profile If a RoutingOption is set in the 
request it dominates the entry in the appropriate properties definition file.</value>

  <data name="labGEODATASOURCE_LAYER.ToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Adds a geodatasource layer which will be considered when executing the service method in question. 
The format is &lt;geodatasource configuration&gt;.&lt;layer name&gt;[.&lt;geodata profile&gt;][;&lt;SQL filter&gt;]. 
When using attribute names, put them into brackets, such as [id] = 42. 
Examples: 'default.traffic' - 'default.traffic.avoid-all' - 'default.traffic.avoid-all;[id] in (0815,4711)'.
The SQL filter will be attached at the end of the WHERE clause.
Valid expressions are comparisons (&lt;, &gt;, =, like, ...). 
Concatinations of expressions are possible with the SQL operators AND and OR.</value>

  <data name="gbxExceptionPath.ToolTip" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Describes a route path which has to be treated as ExceptionPath in the next route calculation. Use this option to calculate alternative routes, for example. NOTE: Only the first non-empty attribute 'nodes', 'extSegments', 'street', and 'binaryPathDesc' is considered. NOTE: If a street segment occurs in more than one instance of ExceptionPath, the final malus for this street segment will be computed as the average of the given maluses. There is on exception to this rule: If the street segment in question occurs in an ExceptionPath element with a malus of -99, the final malus will also be -99. This mechanism allows the client to compute an alternative route by still forcing xRoute to use a special street segment (e.g. a ferry).
